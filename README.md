## **Problem Title**

**SIH 25006: Digital Farm Management Portal for Biosecurity in Pig and Poultry Farms**

## **Problem Description**

### **Background**

Biosecurity plays a vital role in protecting livestock farms, especially pig and poultry farms, from major diseases like Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever. These diseases cause major economic losses, affect food supply, and impact farmer livelihoods. Many small and marginal farmers lack access to easy, practical information on biosecurity, risk assessment, and regulatory requirements.

### **Problem Statement**

There is a need for a simple and accessible digital platform that helps farmers effectively follow biosecurity practices. The platform should support:

* Farm-level risk assessments based on local disease trends.
* Training modules with videos, images, and step-by-step guides.
* Tools for compliance tracking and digital record-keeping.
* Real-time alerts on disease outbreaks or biosecurity breaches.
* A multilingual, farmer-friendly interface suitable for rural areas.

The system should also support data analysis for government agencies, promote collaboration between farmers and veterinarians, and build long-term preparedness against livestock diseases.

### **Expected Outcomes**

* Better awareness of biosecurity among farmers.
* Improved disease prevention and risk management.
* Access to personalized biosecurity guidelines.
* Digital maintenance of farm records.
* Faster alerts and timely action during outbreaks.
* Better livestock health and improved productivity.
* Empowerment of resource-poor farmers.
* Data support for government surveillance and policy making.
* Improved coordination among stakeholders.
* Stronger national protection against zoonotic diseases.

## **Problem Creator’s Organization**

**Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying**

## **Theme**

**Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D)**

## **Proposed Solution**

The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management and Biosecurity Portal designed to make biosecurity simple and actionable for pig and poultry farmers. The portal will offer a personalized dashboard for performing risk assessments based on location, livestock numbers, and disease trends.
It will generate farm-specific biosecurity plans, provide checklists for daily monitoring, and store records such as cleaning logs, vaccine schedules, feed records, and visitor entries.

The portal will explain biosecurity practices using short videos, illustrations, and easy-to-follow modules. Automated alerts will notify farmers of disease risks and necessary preventive actions. The platform will include multilingual support, offline features, a mobile-first design, and the ability to integrate with government systems for future expansion.

## **Technical Approach**

The portal will use a modern web and mobile technology stack.

* **Backend:** Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js
* **Frontend:** React or Angular
* **Mobile App:** Flutter or React Native
* **Database:** Firebase or AWS RDS
* **Notifications:** Real-time APIs

The development process will include gathering requirements, designing user flows, prototyping, and continuous testing. Dashboards will be created for farmers, veterinarians, and officials to ensure smooth communication and accurate data sharing.

## **Feasibility and Viability**

The project is highly feasible due to increasing smartphone use and government support for digital farming. Cloud-based systems provide scalability and reliability.

Challenges like poor connectivity, farmer hesitation, and data accuracy can be managed through offline modes, awareness programs, and integration with verified government databases. Regular updates will keep the platform effective and user-friendly.

## **Impact and Benefits**

This solution will strengthen biosecurity across pig and poultry farms, reducing disease outbreaks and economic losses. Farmers will gain better livestock health, higher productivity, and access to expert guidance. The platform promotes sustainable farming, supports national food security, and reduces dependency on antibiotics. It empowers small and marginal farmers, improves data-driven decision-making, and contributes to national preparedness against zoonotic diseases.

## **Research and References**

The project is based on biosecurity guidelines from FAO, OIE, and the Department of Animal Husbandry & Dairying. Additional inputs come from research on disease transmission, farmer training methods, and global digital agriculture systems. These references ensure scientific accuracy and practical usability of the solution.
